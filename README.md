🐱 MITSY QUEST: The Grand Challenge

MITSY QUEST is a high-octane, neon-soaked word unscrambling game designed to test your vocabulary under pressure. Set against a deep-space cyberpunk backdrop, you have 60 seconds to solve each muddled word before the timer hits zero.

🎮 Gameplay Features

The 20-Word Gauntlet: Each session pulls a randomized selection of 20 questions from our massive linguistic database.

Cyberpunk Aesthetics: Experience fluid starfield backgrounds, neon-pink UI, and retro-futuristic sound effects.

Rematch System: Any word you skip isn't gone forever—it enters the "Skip Pool" for a final high-stakes showdown at the end of the round.

Interactive UI: Click-to-place and click-to-remove mechanics make unscrambling intuitive and fast.

Dynamic Feedback: Real-time "shaking" effects for wrong answers and celebratory confetti for victories.

🕹️ How to Play

The Mission: Read the sentence provided and look at the "muddled" word highlighted in neon blue.

Unscramble: Click the letter tiles in the pool to fill the empty slots.

The Timer: You have 60 seconds per word. When the clock hits 15s, the interface will enter "Danger Mode" (flashing red).

Skip Strategy: If you're stuck, use the SKIP button. These words will return at the very end for a "Rematch Round."

Win: Complete all 20 words to see your final score and claim your status as a Word Master.
